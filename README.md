### 📘 Notes

💙 I assure you, this will be your favorite notes app.
🔒 You can sign up and log in simply with your name, email, and password.
📌 Pin and search your notes as if it's your real _dashboard_, you know.
🏷️ You can add tags, too. If you want, I can add functions such as managing your notes by tags.
📮 Freely give your thoughts! I'll appreciate them.
🌐 I even provided the backend myself. 👉 https://github.com/millersplanet/notes-backend



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
